# generator-wordpress-plugin

> The best way to start creating your WordPress plugin projects.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-wordpress-plugin using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-wordpress-plugin
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo wordpress-plugin
```

Once you are inside a existing project, generated with this tool you can also do:
```bash
yo wordpress-plugin:metabox MyMetabox
yo wordpress-plugin:shortcode MyShortcode
yo wordpress-plugin:widget MyWidget
```

The generator will take care to update your plugin main class to include the newly generated classes.

## Development

Until the module it's not yet available as a global npm module. A global module may be created and symlinked to a local one, using npm.

Move inside the project folder and type:

```bash
npm link
```

That will install your project dependencies and symlink a global module to your local file. After npm is done, you'll be able to call `yo wordpress-plugin`
